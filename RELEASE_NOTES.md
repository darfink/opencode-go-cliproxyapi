## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix missing Responses stream item lifecycle completion events (output_text.done, content_part.done, function_call_arguments.done, output_item.done) prior to response.completed, resolving dropped assistant output and tool calls in OpenAI Codex CLI and strict Responses clients.
- Fix handling of in-history messages with role: "system" across protocol adapters without rejecting them as unsupported roles or forwarding invalid turn roles to upstream providers that require alternating user/assistant turns.
- Fix handling of multi-part content arrays in function_call_output.output under /v1/responses decoding.
- Fix upstream HTTP >= 400 error propagation in streaming and non-streaming requests by reading and extracting the upstream error payload instead of discarding it with generic fallback errors.
- Add two-way Responses tool namespace and additional_tools translation: merge dynamic declarations from input items (type: "additional_tools"), unroll client-side grouping tools (type: "namespace") into qualified wire names for upstream models, and restore original tool names and namespaces across non-streaming output and streaming SSE events for OpenAI Codex CLI and multi-agent harnesses.


## Upgrade Notes
