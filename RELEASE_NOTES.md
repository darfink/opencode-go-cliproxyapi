## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix missing Responses stream item lifecycle completion events (output_text.done, content_part.done, function_call_arguments.done, output_item.done) prior to response.completed, resolving dropped assistant output and tool calls in OpenAI Codex CLI and strict Responses clients.
- Fix handling of in-history messages with role: "system" across protocol adapters without rejecting them as unsupported roles or forwarding invalid turn roles to upstream providers that require alternating user/assistant turns.
- Fix handling of multi-part content arrays in function_call_output.output under /v1/responses decoding.
- Fix upstream HTTP >= 400 error propagation in streaming and non-streaming requests by reading and extracting the upstream error payload instead of discarding it with generic fallback errors.


## Upgrade Notes

- Replace the old plugin binary with the new release binary.
- Restart CLIProxyAPI after replacing the plugin.
- Hard-refresh Management Center if the plugin page looks stale.
