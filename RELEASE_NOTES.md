## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix missing Responses stream item lifecycle completion events (output_text.done, content_part.done, function_call_arguments.done, output_item.done) prior to response.completed, resolving dropped assistant output and tool calls in OpenAI Codex CLI and strict Responses clients (credited to kanechoo and samaluk forks).


## Upgrade Notes

- Replace the old plugin binary with the new release binary.
- Restart CLIProxyAPI after replacing the plugin.
- Hard-refresh Management Center if the plugin page looks stale.
